## <span style="color: #228B22"> Causes of Climate Change </span>
Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as deforestation and industrial processes, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat and lead to a warming effect.

<!-- Section: What is Lung Cancer? -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> What is Lung Cancer? </span>

<!-- Description of lung cancer -->
Lung cancer occurs when abnormal cells in the lung grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor. These tumors can interfere with lung function, making it difficult for the affected person to breathe. Lung cancer can be broadly categorized into two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

<!-- Section: Types of Lung Cancer -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> Types of Lung Cancer </span>

<!-- Descriptions of NSCLC and SCLC -->
- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The most common type, accounting for around 85% of all lung cancer cases, with three subtypes.
- Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC): Less common but grows and spreads more quickly than NSCLC.

<!-- Section: Causes and Risk Factors -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> Causes and Risk Factors </span>

<!-- Factors contributing to lung cancer -->
The primary cause of lung cancer is exposure to carcinogens, with tobacco smoke being the leading risk factor. Other risk factors include secondhand smoke, exposure to radon gas, workplace exposures, and a family history of lung cancer.

<!-- Section: Signs and Symptoms -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> Signs and Symptoms </span>

<!-- Common symptoms of lung cancer -->
Common symptoms of lung cancer may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, coughing up blood, and recurrent infections. Some cases may be asymptomatic in the early stages.

<!-- Section: Diagnosis and Staging -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> Diagnosis and Staging </span>

<!-- Overview of diagnosing lung cancer -->
Diagnosing lung cancer involves a combination of imaging tests, biopsies, and staging to determine the extent of the disease. Staging helps in planning appropriate treatment strategies.

<!-- Section: Treatment Options -->
## <span style="color: #228B22"> Treatment Options </span>

<!-- Description of treatment options -->
Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the type, stage, and overall health of the patient. They may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and palliative care.

### Impact

![Alt text](images/IMPACT.png)

[**Home Page**](/index.md)

<!-- Introduction and title of the page -->
Climate change does not directly cause lung cancer. Instead, lung cancer primarily results from exposure to carcinogens, with tobacco smoke being the leading risk factor. However, climate change can indirectly influence lung cancer risk through several mechanisms:

1. [Air Quality and Pollution](#air-quality-and-pollution)
2. [Wildfires](#wildfires)
3. [Vector-Borne Diseases](#vector-borne-diseases)
4. [Heat Stress](#heat-stress)
5. [Altered Allergen Distribution](#altered-allergen-distribution)

<!-- Subsections related to climate change's impact on lung cancer -->

## <span style="color: #228B22"> Air Quality and Pollution </span>

<!-- Subsection title -->
Climate change can exacerbate air pollution, which may contain fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, and other pollutants harmful to respiratory health. Prolonged exposure to polluted air can increase the risk of lung cancer.

## <span style="color: #228B22"> Wildfires </span>

<!-- Subsection title -->
Rising global temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can contribute to an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires. Wildfires release a range of harmful air pollutants, including particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. Prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke can harm lung health and potentially increase lung cancer risk.

## <span style="color: #228B22"> Vector-Borne Diseases </span>

<!-- Subsection title -->
Climate change can expand the geographical range of certain disease vectors like mosquitoes. This can lead to an increased risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria or Zika, which can impact lung health when these diseases affect the respiratory system.

## <span style="color: #228B22"> Heat Stress </span>

<!-- Subsection title -->
Extreme heat events associated with climate change can lead to heat-related illnesses, potentially increasing the risk of respiratory infections that may, in some cases, contribute to lung cancer risk.

## <span style="color: #228B22"> Altered Allergen Distribution </span>

<!-- Subsection title -->
Climate change can affect the distribution and prevalence of allergenic pollen-producing plants. For individuals with allergies or asthma, exposure to increased pollen can exacerbate respiratory issues. While allergies themselves are not a direct cause of lung cancer, ongoing respiratory inflammation from allergens can increase the risk of lung damage.

<!-- A call to action and conclusion section -->
Addressing climate change is important for protecting public health and reducing the risk of various respiratory ailments.
